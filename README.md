## Tuwaiq Final Project
Every student has gone through a stage of not being sure of their study, and certainly, you were also not sure that you had studied the material well. Yes, you needed someone to test you in your subjects.

This is the idea of our application. We use artificial intelligence to test you with your materials. All you have to do is upload the material as a pdf file, and our application will test you!

## Here comes our turn at :

- Students can create and take exams by just uploading their material.

- Make their exams private or public so other students can benefit from them.

- Set up their calendar so they can keep track of their actual exams!
